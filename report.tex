\section{Project Objective}
Aim to introduce static code analysis tools to analyze and understand security
issues relating to development of net-based applications, and be in a position
to utilize programming techniques as defense against different kinds of
security risks.

\begin{defn}
``Static code analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed
without actually executing programs built from that software.''  - Wikipedia
\end{defn}
Today, There are different types of analyzer available in the market,
both commercial and open-source. KlockWork, CodeSecure and Fortify can be an
examples of static code analyzers.
In this we mainly focused on Fortify static software security analyzer.


\section{What is Fortify?}
Fortify Source Code Analyzer (SCA) is a set of software security analyzers
that search for violations of security‐specific coding rules and guidelines in
a variety of languages. The rich data provided by Fortify SCA language
technology enables the analyzers to pinpoint and prioritize violations.
In The analysis information produced by SCA helps us deliver more secure
software, as well as making security code reviews more efficient, consistent,
and complete. This is especially advantageous when large code bases are
involved. The modular architecture of SCA allows you to quickly upload new,
third party, and customer‐specific security rules. [www.fortify.com]

From a list of suggested projects, we have chosen OpenXdata source code as an
input to static software analyzer.


\section{What is OpenXdata?}
“OpenXdata is a community-developed, open-source, enterprise end-to-end
software solution for handling virtually any type of forms based data
collection and management using mobile devices and web forms
(online or offline).

OpenXdata is the first FREE and completely OPEN SOURCE end-to-end
solution of its kind that can use both high- and low-end mobile devices
and mobile phones as well as in a regular web-browser to show and
capture forms based data.”


\section{What is needed to perform analysis?}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Fortify Software with license (fortify.com)
 \item OpenXdata source code (trac.openxdata.org)
 \item Ubuntu 10.10
 \item Eclipse IDE 3.6
\end{itemize}

\section{System Setup}

\subsection{Fortify}

Installation of Fortify Source Code Analysis Suite on Ubuntu 10.10 was straight forward. We used the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Downloaded the tarball file from: http://software.ii.uib.no/uib/inf226/fortify/ (FrAcademicmLicensence)
 \item We extract the tarball using the following command: tar xvzf Fortify-360-2.6.5-Analyzers_and_Apps-Linux-x86.tar.gz
 \item Copy the fortify.license file into installation directory.
 \item To update rule packs, under bin directory of Fortify, we run rulepackupdate on the terminal window.
 \item run eclipsepostinstall, under the Fortify/bin folder.
\end{itemize}

Fortify as standalone analyzer and with eclipse have been done successfully without any challenge.
The next step was importing OpenXdata into eclipse IDE.

What is required to build and run OpenXdata?
\begin{itemize}
 \item Java JDK 6
 \item MySQL
 \item Apache Tomcat 6
 \item Maven
 \item (Subversion)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{OpenXData}
How to build retrieve and build OpenXdata?
Since we the source code is provided by the course, we don’t need to do a checkout from Subversion. So we just need to run `mvn clean install`
How to run OpenXdata?
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Install Apache Tomcat 6 
 \item Install MySQL
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Create database called openxdata
  \item Grant the default user openxdata/openxdata
 \end{enumerate}
 \item Deploy admin/target/admin.war to Apache Tomcat
 \item OpenXdata will create and populate the database
 \item Open the browser at http://localhost:8080/admin
\end{enumerate}

\section{Critical}

\subsection{Cross-site Scripting: Persistence}
Fortify found 3 security flaws, all of them are false positves.

CSVDataExport.java:117
printWriter.write(line + "\\n");
The produced output is a CSV file, and is not supposed to be executed by the browser.

DefaultXformSerializer.java:64
dos.writeUTF(xml);
The produced output is a defined binary protocol, the data is read by the mobile client with a parser made by OpenXData

DefaultXformSerializer.java:82
dos.writeUTF((String)study[1]);
Same issue as the previous.

\subsection{Cross-Site Scripting: Reflected}
StudyExportServlet.java:106
response.getOutputStream().println(message);
This is a real issue when the browser executes this as JavaScript.

Message is generated like this
request.getParameter("type") + " is not a valid valid type"

The code is used for error reporting, but it also sets the content type to "text/plain".
This migth reduce the posibility to exploit the security bug.

\subsection{Password Management: Hardcoded Password}
Fortify reports about three issues, all of them are within the tests that are only used
by developers to automated tests. We consider them as false positves since OpenXdata don't
include them for users.

\subsection{Path Manipulation}
from BirtImagesServlet.java:61
FileInputStream is = new FileInputStream(pathName + request.getParameter("imageName"));

This allows the attacker to read all files that the servlet container have access to.

OTAServlet.java:79
The same as previous, but makes it harder for the attacker.

OpenXDataPropertyPlaceholderConfigurer.java:96 and OpenXDataUtil.java:79 
is false positives since the variable are from the propertyfile that the system administrator provides OpenXdata.
